# Image Classifier for Cat Identification

In this assignment, I developed a simple image classifier to identify whether an image contains a cat using logistic regression.

## Examples

Here are two examples:

![Cat Image 1](/images/output1.png)
![Cat Image 2](/images/output2.png)

## Learning Curve

Below is the learning curve, showing how the cost function changes for each iteration:
